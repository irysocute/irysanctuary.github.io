      <p>It was the second time IRyS sang 悪魔の子, the ED of 進撃の巨人. It was totally different from the just-learned one, I almost can see Eren Yaeger in IRyS' voice. The difference showed me how serious IRyS thinks of her every singing and how hard IRyS keeps practicing and improving, even it's just an usual karaoke streaming. IRySoPro,definitely.</p>

I remembered in Youtube Chat that someone was saying "Baldrys" and I thought that I would also go with it and then suddenly many people in the chat have started spamming baldrys until irys actually noticed which made her laugh.

It showed me that they are so many different country's views and pets, and then let me know so many IRyS' reaction and opinion! Let me have a better understanding of my oshi! And I feel like make connection with different fans in the world. To me, it's really a unique experience! When I first time hear you singing, I can feel my heart seethed. And I fall into the voice and the reaction you have. I always think about that I'm too late to meet IRyS. So, to make it up! I'll as much as possible to give buck to my oshi! The luckiest thing in my life is meet IRyS. Thank you for company me when I feel alone. In the following days, I will support you till the end of my heart! Please take care of yourself!

      <p>My favourite scene is actually from the stream where you showed everybody the touch grass shirt that me and my dog Happy wore. However I'm choosing this particular scene from your Terraria stream because it is precious to me personally. I asked you in chat, "how was the gyoza?"; you answered "gyoza was great". That was it - that 1 second short, seemly insignificant reply - is what made me decide to be your loyal fan. It was the first time I received a response from you; even knowing that you didn't even look at who typed what in chat, I was still so happy. If you ever wonder whether or not you matter in this world, please do know that there's somebody in this world who treasures every word you say. Happy anniversary, IRyS! I wish you all the success and happiness.</p>

      <p>This is the exact moment IRyS went down in Holo EN Elden Ring History and won the the Big Tree Sentinel Race. IRyS's ER streams were among my favorite streams to watch. Cheering her on as she learned the game and got really good at it was some of the most fun I had just watching someone play a game, lol. She may not stream it now, but I always hope she's having fun with it on her own time. Cheers to you, IRyS, Legendary Tree Sentinel Arse Kicker! o7</p>

      <p>This is the one of my most Favorite scene to Irys it's almost hard to decide which one should I pick because many of her streams was memorable. Therefore I remember the first saw her was playing Debut Minecraft I was curious about her so I watch this stream. She was cute back then when learning new things in Minecraft and when she entered the wrong server I thought she was panic and scared but she was saved by her Senpai Polka for while . "She was my Batman!" The moment she said that was I started liking her many streams but even tho I'm busy irl thanks to the clippers I catch along her other streams. I have a dramatic reason so that's why I want to thanks IRyS so much to give me another chance to live and that's all want. 🙂</p>

      <p>I like everything about IRyS, she's just perfect for me. So, it is a bit tricky for me to choose one from so many highlights moment of her stream. But, if only I can pick one. I would say it's probably this one. Oh man, this one is just so freaking hilarious to me. IRyS dubbing Bae is soooo on point and accurate. I would never forget when that time I was a bit late(like several minute)to the stream and because I just waking up and don't pay enough attention to it. It actually takes me another several minute to realize that it's actually IRyS speaking behind the scene, not Bae. And the whole stream was IRys dubbing it all. I was so shock at that moment...and admired at the same time. And then, Calli called-in in the middle of the stream. She then shouted in disbelief: "Why are you sounds like each other ??" "God...How much do you guys hang out? Like I don't understand..." "Look, I know you guys are like...married and shit but like...WHAT THE FU**" Yeah Calli, now you share the same feeling as I do. And you just take the word right out of my mouth. This is exactly what I was thinking at the time. About how good IRyS really is at the dub and she really nailed it big time. IRyS is so talented, not just in singing but almost in every aspect. I also know that it isn't not just about she's gifted, but she worked really hard too. And that's what I like about her.</p>
