		  &nbsp &nbsp With the release of Journey, Evan came up with the idea of showing IRyS how much IRyStocrats love the album! We finally decided to make &nbsp &nbsp<br>
		  <br>
		  &nbsp &nbsp a photographic mosaic with as many pictures of the physical album that IRyStocrats have purchased, and try to post the event to IRyS &nbsp &nbsp<br>
		  <br>
		  &nbsp &nbsp through Twitter, with messages attached below from as many members as we could! &nbsp &nbsp<br>
          <br>
		  &nbsp &nbsp We've also organized a survey in addition to the photographic mosaic asking a series of questions on how the members liked the album. We &nbsp &nbsp<br>
		  <br>
		  &nbsp &nbsp thought this would be a good opportunity to show our appreciation for IRyS's hard work and the amount of support our lovely IRyStocrats have! &nbsp &nbsp<br>

          <br>
		  &nbsp &nbsp We asked the IRyStocrats their favorite song in Journey, how they listen to it, and if they are from overseas or within Japan. &nbsp &nbsp <br>
          <br>
		  &nbsp &nbsp This is the result we collected from the survey with 112 album submissions &nbsp &nbsp <br>
