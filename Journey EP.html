		  &nbsp &nbsp With the release of Journey, Evan came up with the idea of showing IRyS how much IRyStocrats love the album! &nbsp &nbsp<br>
		  <br>
		  &nbsp &nbsp We finally decided to make a photographic mosaic with as many pictures of the physical album that IRyStocrats have purchased, and try to &nbsp &nbsp<br>
		  <br>
		  &nbsp &nbsp post the event to IRyS through Twitter, with messages attached below from as many members as we could! &nbsp &nbsp<br>
		  <br>
		  &nbsp &nbsp We've also organized a survey in addition to the photographic mosaic asking a series of questions on how the members liked the album. &nbsp &nbsp<br>
		  <br>

          I am so surprised of the EP that actually has a story when IRyS explained it and the story is really interesting looking at how Hope fell to despair and gain back Hope but stronger. Personally I really like the song "Nameless Sadness", which the title itself cannot describe the kind of sadness when you find out the truth is not what you see, and start to have doubt to what you believe. The lyrics is strong enough but IRyS singing bringing it out even stronger feeling, it makes me goosebumps whenever I listen to this song.

          This is the first EP I bought in my life. It's really heartbreaking to see IRyS works hard and even a throat injury. I hope to try my best to let the little princess know that IRyStocrats support her very much and look forward to her growth in the future.

          Hi, IRyS. When I first listened to the album ‚ÄúJourney‚Äù, my first thought was - perfect. I have to say that this is the first time in my life that I bought a record to support a singer because I was moved. I hope you can create more works, but please don't be under pressure. Health is the most important thing, whether it is mental or physical.

          It's such a great EP! It showcases IRyS's ability as an artist, and how versatile she is. I love the theme of losing hope, and finding it again. Many people can relate to the theme of the entire album.

          It is packed with emotions from IRyS as she descends to our realm and experiences the World, full of majestic wonders and angelic splendors but also filled with evil maliciousness and deep darkness from the human soul. But even when she is filled with sadness, despair and anger at this world, she also sees the small little light of Hope that lingers on. Sheltering that little spark of Hope, weathering the storm of human emotions to finally emerge on the other side triumphantly, understanding that despite all our flaws and scars, we all have the potential to bring Hope to the world with our words and actions, those buds hiding deep within, ready to flower forth in its beauty and splendor as we show kindness and love to everyone.

          I knew u hurt your vocal cords while recording journey, I can tell that u really put all your heart into this EP. U did a really great job in it, tried to perform every line flawlessly. IRyS never let all IRyStrocats down, all songs in journey are all bangers. The whole EP exactly is the journey of a nephilim, who was so confident to spend hope to other find out that the reality is full of despair people lose faith in things easily, so she started to questioning herself and struggled if she should continue spend hope or juz give up, at the end nephilim choose to continue bring hope to other. Although there may be a host of barriers and difficulties, hope is a really important element in everyone's life, so never losing hope to anything. IRyS will always be here as long as we have hope in our heart. U are my push forever, looking forward to your future plans. IRyStrocats will always be with you! Stay happy stay healthy, I wish u all the best.

It shows how IRyS as "hope" sees the world and explores it from the surface to the core, and even after seeing all the bad things, she still accepts it and is willing to save it.
